# (BOX_ACCESS_TOKEN below is the literal sentinel "proxy-managed", not a real
#  secret — the sbx proxy swaps in the real token outbound. Lint false positive.)
#
# Box Mount overlay — carries the private box-mount client and the runtime ENV.
#
# MIGRATION NOTE (v2 → v3): this replaces the v2 ../../Dockerfile. v2 baked the
# binary into a SEPARATE prebuilt image (FROM the shell template) because a v2
# mixin could ship no content; the mixin then composed onto that custom image.
# v3 mixins carry an overlay, so the binary ships here and lands on ANY base.
# Because this is an overlay (not a root filesystem), there is NO ENTRYPOINT —
# the base workload's launch command stays and the user/agent runs box-mount
# from the shell.
#
# The box-mount binary (~20–34 MB) is private/confidential (Box preview) and is
# git-ignored — stage it under the kit's own build context before building:
#   v3/box-mount/bin/linux/amd64/box-mount   (linux/amd64)
#   v3/box-mount/bin/linux/arm64/box-mount   (linux/arm64)
# A kit's build context is rooted at its own directory, so the binary must live
# inside v3/box-mount/ (it cannot reach the repo-root box-mount/ tree).
#
# TARGETARCH is amd64 or arm64, set automatically per platform by buildx, so a
# single `--platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64` build bakes the right binary into
# each arch. The sbx runtime does NOT emulate, so the arch must match the host.

# The overlay: FROM scratch keeps the layer purely the binary below plus the
# ENV, which rides in the image config. The frontend stages the descriptor as a
# content layer alongside it.
FROM scratch
ARG TARGETARCH

# v0.4.0 note (carried from v2): the `mount` command self-invokes a helper
# executable named `box-mount` on PATH (the sync engine), so the binary MUST be
# installed under that name or `mount` fails with FileNotFoundError. We also
# install an `agent-mount` alias so the older CLI surface keeps working.
# COPY --chown/--chmod sets ownership (root:root) and mode at copy time — the
# files land under /usr/local/bin owned 0/0, which the overlay-ownership audit
# requires (every owner must be 0/0 or 1000/1000; /home is untouched here).
COPY --chown=root:root --chmod=0755 bin/linux/${TARGETARCH}/box-mount /usr/local/bin/box-mount
COPY --chown=root:root --chmod=0755 bin/linux/${TARGETARCH}/box-mount /usr/local/bin/agent-mount

# v2 environment.variables → ENV (must be on the recipe's final stage to merge
# at assembly). This is the sentinel box-mount reads to build its
# `Authorization: Bearer` header; the sbx proxy rewrites that header to the real
# token on outbound Box requests (see credential@1 in box-mount.yaml), so the
# real token never enters the container. When the (optional) box credential IS
# bound, proxyManaged injects its own sentinel into BOX_ACCESS_TOKEN at create
# and this image value is overridden; this ENV is the fallback that keeps the
# sentinel present — exactly as v2 did — when no token is set.
ENV BOX_ACCESS_TOKEN="proxy-managed"
